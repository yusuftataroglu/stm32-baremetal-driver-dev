# Experiment 001 - LED Toggle

## Description
This experiment demonstrates how to configure a GPIO pin as an output and toggle an onboard LED (PA5) at regular intervals using software delay.

## Concepts Practiced
- GPIO output mode
- Pin initialization structure "GPIO_Handle_t"
- Bit-level pin control
- Basic delay loops (not time-accurate)

## Circuit
- LED: PA5 (onboard NUCLEO LED)

## Expected Behavior
The LED toggles ON and OFF continuously with a visible delay.

## Result
Successfully tested on NUCLEO-F103RB.
