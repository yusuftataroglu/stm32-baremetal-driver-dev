# Experiment 006 - SPI with 74HC595 Shift Register

## Description
This experiment demonstrates SPI communication using a 74HC595 shift register to control 8 output LEDs. The STM32F103 microcontroller acts as the SPI master, sending 8-bit data patterns to the shift register via the SPI1 peripheral.

## Concepts Practiced
- SPI peripheral configuration in master mode
- Software slave management (SSM) and internal slave select (SSI) handling
- Blocking SPI transmit using SPI_SendData()
- Synchronization of latch signal (RCLK) for 74HC595
- Timing and control of SPI enable/disable sequences

## Circuit
- 74HC595:
  - SER (DS): connected to MOSI (PA7)
  - SRCLK: connected to SCK (PA5)
  - RCLK: connected to GPIO PA0 (latch control)
  - OE: tied to GND (always enabled)
  - MR: tied to VCC (no reset)
- LEDs: Connected to QAâ€“QH of 74HC595 via resistors

## Expected Behavior
- The shift register receives alternating data patterns: "0xAA" and "0x55" (10101010 and 01010101).
- LEDs toggle in these patterns nearly every 0.5 seconds.
- SPI peripheral is explicitly enabled and disabled for each transfer.
- Latch pin is pulsed after each SPI transaction to update LED outputs.

## Result
Successfully tested on NUCLEO-F103RB.  
SPI peripheral transmits 8-bit data correctly to 74HC595. LED patterns confirm proper SPI operation and timing.
